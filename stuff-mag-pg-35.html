                            The galaxy might look pretty roomy, but
                            you can't move for alien-infested space 
                            stations up there these days. The latest
                            is Talos 1, scene of some experiements on
                            a breed of shape-shifters called Typhons.
                            Alas, the ship now resembles a Typhon
                            safari park - and these alien beasts don't
                            just want your windscreen wipers.<br/>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;You play as Morgan Yu, a scientist who
                            has been developing a way to harness

                            their special skills. These will give you
                            a whole range of ways to play the game.
                            enabling you to hack doors, move heavy
                            objects and sneak through ventillation
                            shafts. You'll unlock these skills as you
                            progress, but at the start you're just a
                            plain old walking sack of meat.<br/>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately, you also have guns.
                            Our favourite weapon so far is the GLOO
                            Canon, a cross between a flamethrower

                            and a fire extinguisher that can be used
                            to trap enemies, create ramps and cover
                            up holes in fire-spewing pipes.<br/>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;But it's the shape-shifting skills that
                            make <em>Prey</em> such a tense experience.
                            With the aliens able to take the form
                            of any object, even the safest-looking
                            room could be crawling with them. It's
                            just as well you can beat them at their
                            own game.
